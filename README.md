# Weight Converter

This is a simple Weight Converter web application that allows users to convert weight from pounds to kilograms. The application is built using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript.

## Features

- Converts weight from pounds to kilograms.
- Takes input in pounds and displays the result in kilograms.
- Handles invalid input with an error message.

## Project Structure

- `index.html`: The main HTML file that contains the structure of the weight converter interface.
- `style.css`: The CSS file that styles the weight converter, including the input field and result display.
- `index.js`: The JavaScript file that handles the logic for converting pounds to kilograms and displaying the result.
